1) My mom is humiliated by me whick makes me really sad. Feeling that a person is humiliated by your presense is the worst thing a person can feel.

2) I am a hard core introvert and i don't understand that why does a person need to wear nice clothes wherever he goes. I guess i know clothes are used to increase ones status. I was wondering whether my parents think i decrease their status. So i don't want to be with them or anyone. I don't want anyone to be ashamed of me.

3) I am leaving college and taking a 6 month break. This makes me really afraid. I have hidden so much from everyone. I am in huge stress. I sometimes think about what if things don't work out? My sister is currently in USA and is also pushing me to do GRE. For much time can i carry out this fake appearance. Dropping out is a big choice to make. Is it the right thinkg to do? I don't know. But this is what i have decided to do. Atleast for the time being. 

4) I feel that i am below my sister. She is pretty hot. Working in US. Has boys all around her. While i am dropping out. With a 5.95 CPGA. Going to a job with just 10k pay. I am fat 108kg and haven't ever kissed a girl even though i hav lied to my friends that i have. 

5) I don't like my family. They make me sad. Whenever i come home. I feel sad. So i am thinking of never coming to home again. 

6) I am irriated by the clothes. My sister and mom make fun of weight. I have to wear tight clothes that i am not comfortable wearing. I hate them. I don't want to go to the party today because - 
- I will have to wear jeans that i don't like
- I will have to wear a tight shirt. That i fucking dont like. How i can a person enjoy himself if he has to take care of his appearance all the time?
